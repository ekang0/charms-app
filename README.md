# Charms App
>Charms is an app for wizards and muggles to learn spells and their effects.
This app was originally designed for Hogwarts students to use as a reference guide but is now open to all who are seeking to aquire more knowledge about charms. Though the spells existing in the wizarding world rarely change, a field to submit and add a spell has been provided.

## Charms App Philosophy
>As Mr. Harry Potter once said, "Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more: BELIEVING IN YOURSELF." 
Though this app will help one learn about the spell, incantation and effect, it is up to oneself to believe that in their abilities to perform it. All that come to the Charms app are students, so students wands at the ready. ðŸª„ Let's begin!

# App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
