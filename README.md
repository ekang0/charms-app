# Charms App
>Charms is an project created with React, Javascript, and CSS for wizards and muggles to learn spells and their effects. 🧙🏻‍♀️🧙🏽🧙🏿‍♂️💫

## Charms App Status
This project was originally designed for Hogwarts students to use as an alternative and supplemental resource to the coursebook by providing an online reference guide to spells, but is now open to all who are seeking to aquire more knowledge about charms. Though the spells existing in the wizarding world rarely change, a field to submit and add a spell has been provided.

## Charms App Philosophy
As Mr. Harry Potter once said, "Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more: BELIEVING IN YOURSELF." 
<br />
Though this app will help one learn about the spell, incantation and effect, it is up to oneself to believe in their abilities to perform it. All that come to the Charms app are students, so students wands at the ready. 🪄 Let's begin!
